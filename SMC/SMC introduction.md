## Introduction
* an effective robust control strategy
* for incomletely modeled or nonlinear system
* One of the most distinguished properties:
    * It utilizes a discontinuous control action, which switches between two distinctively different system structures.  
    a new type of system motion--sliding mode--exists in a specified manifold  
    
* a wide spectrum of systems: nonlinear; time-varying; discrete; large-scale; infinite-dimentional; stochastic; distributed system.

### Fundamental Theory of SMC
$ \dot x(t)=f(x,u,t)$
