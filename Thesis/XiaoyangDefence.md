##### Questions
###### 1.
1. Whether there is an improvement of the modeling?
2. What are the assumptions in your thesis?
3. Better move the section to the end?
4. How deal with these uncertainties?

5. modeling, which one will be more important or more significant
###### 2.
Don't have questions  
The link is a little weak.
1. What is the application of your thesis? This maybe the missing link.
2. How to explain the control surface? 
3. More explain about the reason why nonlinear is important.
* 4. Can you seperate the contribution to aerodynamics modeling, what you did as a contribution in modeling and control?
5. What is the difference between adaptive and active control in your thesis? Add some page to explain the passive, active, adaptive control.

More for the readers.
###### 3.
1. nonlinear-which part
2. Urban area link. More physical applications may be better.  
3. Assumption-nonlinear dynamics, gaussian disturbance.  
4. Slides-  
5. Mian contribution in modeling is to combine, make the dynamical more clear.  

Many it bigger, explain what is presenting.
The figures cited need to be note out.--for readers.
######
Adaptive<Active control  
Normal PD controller did not include the dynamics.
1. Why not many people work on active control?
2. Application of this thesis, who will benifit?
