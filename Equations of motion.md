# Equations of Motion
* describe the behavior of a physical system in terms of its motion as a function of time. `motion=f(time)`  
* functions can bedescribed in a Euclidean space in classical mathematics
  * replaced by curved spaces in relativity.  
* there are two main descriptions: `dynamics` and `kinematics`.  
`dynamimcs` more general. momenta, forces and energy are take into account.
`kinematics` simpler. It concerns only variables derived from the positions and time. Usually refer to as `the SUVAT euations`.  
`SUVAT` s=displacement, u=initial velocity, a=ccelleration, t=time.

`Formally, an equation of motion _M_ of an object is a function of position _r_, velocity _\dot r_ and acceleration _\ddor r_.  
* the equation sometimes is linear and more likely to be exactly sovable.
* in general, the equation will be nonlinear and can not be solved exactly, approximations must be used. The soutions to nonlinear equations
 may show chaotic depending on how sensitive the system is to the innitial conditions.
