#### What is Genetic Algorithm
* It uses concepts from _evolutionary biology_ to get global minimum -- solving optimization problem
* Start with an initial generation of candidate solutions that are tested against the objective function
* Subsequent generations evolve from the 1st generation through selection, crossover and mutation.
